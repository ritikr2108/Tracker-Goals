1. How long did you spend on the coding test?

-> I spent approximately **4 hours** working on the coding test. This included time for understanding the requirements, designing the solution, implementing the necessary features, testing the application, and making necessary adjustments based on testing.

2. What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen language? Please include a snippet of code that shows how you've used it.

- One of the most useful features added to the latest version of **JavaScript** (ES6 and beyond) was the introduction of **async/await** for asynchronous programming. This feature significantly improves the readability and maintainability of code when dealing with asynchronous tasks, as it eliminates the need for chaining multiple `.then()` or using callbacks.

- Another powerful feature, especially in the context of **React**, is **JSX (JavaScript XML)**, which allows developers to write HTML-like syntax directly within JavaScript code. This makes the process of building user interfaces more intuitive and closely aligned with HTML. With JSX, we can define UI components and structure them easily, and the JSX code is then compiled into regular JavaScript function calls.

### Example Code:
```javascript
// Fetching user data asynchronously using async/await
async function getUserData(userId) {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/users/${userId}`);
    const data = await response.json();
    console.log(data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching user data:', error);
  }
}

// JSX Example: React component displaying a user's name
function UserProfile({ user }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{user.name}</h1>
      <p>{user.email}</p>
    </div>
  );
}


3. How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?
To track down a performance issue in production, I would approach it step by step:

-> Analyze Logs: First, I would check the server and client logs to look for any errors or slow parts of the application that could be causing issues.

-> Use Profiling Tools:

Frontend: I would start by using the browserâ€™s built-in developer tools, especially the "Performance" tab, to see how long the page takes to load, how fast the JavaScript runs, and if there are any slow network requests.
Backend: On the server side, I would use monitoring tools to check for slow operations or any parts of the app that take too long to process.
Check for Memory Leaks & Unnecessary Re-renders: In case the problem is related to React, I would use React DevTools to see if there are any unnecessary re-renders happening. I would also check for memory leaks by making sure to clean up any resources in useEffect when components unmount.

-> Optimize Database Queries: If the problem seems to be on the server side, I would look into the database queries. I would check if any queries are taking too long and try to optimize them, maybe by adding indexes or caching frequently accessed data.

-> Load Testing: Lastly, to see how the app holds up under high traffic, I would use tools to simulate a lot of users and check if the app starts slowing down or breaking.

4. If you had more time, what additional features or improvements would you consider adding to the task management application?
  If I had more time, I would consider adding the following features to improve the task management application:

-> Authentication and Authorization: Implement user authentication and authorization using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and Nodemailer for secure login/sign-up functionality. This would tie tasks to specific users and ensure that only authorized users can access their data. The application would require users to register and log in to manage tasks, and tasks would be tied to their user accounts in the database.

-> Task Notifications: Implement due date notifications to alert users when tasks are nearing their due date. This could be achieved using background tasks (e.g., using Node.js cron jobs) or a third-party service to send reminders through email or in-app notifications.

-> Dark Mode: Add a toggle for dark mode, improving the user experience, especially for users who prefer working in low-light environments. This can be implemented using CSS custom properties or theme management libraries like styled-components in React.

-> Task Categories/Labels: Allow users to categorize tasks (e.g., work, personal, shopping) and filter tasks based on their category. This would improve task organization and provide users with a better overview of their tasks.

-> Search Improvements: Enhance the search functionality to support more advanced features, such as searching by multiple parameters (e.g., title, due date, priority). This would allow users to quickly find specific tasks based on various criteria.
